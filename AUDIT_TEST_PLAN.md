# Audit System Test Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the multi-agent audit system in librarian_open. The goal is to ensure that the system can effectively identify and flag various compliance, governance, and data privacy issues within a diverse set of documents.

## 2. Testing Strategy
The testing strategy is based on a "red team" approach, where we create a suite of test documents containing specific, deliberate issues. These documents will be processed by the audit system, and the system's output will be compared against the expected results.

### 2.1. Test Documents
A comprehensive set of test documents has been created in the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` directory. Each document is designed to trigger one or more specific audit agents. The `testDocIndex.md` file provides a detailed breakdown of each document, its purpose, and the expected agent flags.

### 2.2. Agent Behavior Verification
For each test document, we will verify that:
- The correct agents are triggered.
- The agents correctly identify the specific issues within the document.
- The system does not generate false positives.
- The system correctly parses the document's metadata.

## 3. Expected Agent Behavior

### 3.1. Policy Agent
- **Flags:** Contradictory policies, obsolete policies, inconsistencies in governance.
- **Behavior:** This agent should be able to compare policies across different documents and identify conflicts. It should also flag policies that are outdated or no longer relevant.

### 3.2. Legal Agent
- **Flags:** GDPR violations, labor law violations, HIPAA concerns.
- **Behavior:** This agent is responsible for identifying potential legal and regulatory violations. It should be able to detect issues related to data privacy (GDPR), employee rights (labor law), and protected health information (HIPAA).

### 3.3. Governance Agent
- **Flags:** Overdue review dates, missing metadata, inconsistencies in governance.
- **Behavior:** This agent focuses on the administrative and governance aspects of the documents. It should flag documents with overdue review dates, missing or incomplete metadata, and any other deviations from established governance protocols.

## 4. Success Criteria
The audit system will be considered successful if it can:
- Identify at least 95% of the deliberate issues in the test documents.
- Maintain a false positive rate of less than 5%.
- Correctly parse the metadata from all test documents.
